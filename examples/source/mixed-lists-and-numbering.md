# Mixed Lists & Numbering
This example captures a common “breaks everywhere” pattern: numbered lists with nested bullets, mixed list types, continuation detail, and numbering restart after a heading.

## Steps
1. First step
    - Detail bullets under step 1
        - First nested bullet under step 1 detail
        - Second nested bullet under step 1 detail
2. Second step
    - Nested notes under step 2
        - A nested bullet that wraps cleanly when the text is long enough to exceed the content width and must remain aligned to the text start for wrapped lines.

## Restart
After a heading, ordered list numbering restarts.
1. Step one after restart
2. Step two after restart
