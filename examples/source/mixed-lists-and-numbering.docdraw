#1: Mixed Lists & Numbering
p: This example captures a common “breaks everywhere” pattern: numbered lists with nested bullets, mixed list types, continuation detail, and numbering restart after a heading.

#2: Steps
1-1: First step
1-2: Detail bullets under step 1
-3: First nested bullet under step 1 detail
-3: Second nested bullet under step 1 detail
..: Continuation text that belongs to the prior bullet item and must align to the list text start.
1-1: Second step
1-2: Nested notes under step 2
-3: A nested bullet that wraps cleanly when the text is long enough to exceed the content width and must remain aligned to the text start for wrapped lines.

#2: Restart
p: After a heading, ordered list numbering restarts.
1-1: Step one after restart
1-1: Step two after restart
