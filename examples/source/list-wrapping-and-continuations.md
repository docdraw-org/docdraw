# List Wrapping & Continuations
This example stresses wrapping behavior and continuation lines within list items.

- This is a very long bullet item intended to wrap across multiple lines without changing indentation or introducing extra vertical spacing.
- A second top-level bullet to verify spacing between items stays consistent.
    - A nested bullet that should indent exactly one level and wrap cleanly when the line is long enough to exceed the content width.
